                    We are collecting data on the origins of the fibre we use so we can review the flows of fibre from forests to mills to our direct suppliers and into the manufacture of our products.

                We have more than 350 direct suppliers, and require them to provide us with verifiable data on where our products are produced, through a system of self-assessment and regular progress reports using an online system we developed.
                
                In 2016, we simplified the data collection process to reduce the burden on suppliers and improve the accuracy of the data received. This will be rolled out in full in 2017.
                
                We are improving transparency each year, but it remains challenging to trace flows of market pulp and recovered material. We are building partnerships and seeking to influence the industry to make traceability and transparency an accepted part of everyday business.
